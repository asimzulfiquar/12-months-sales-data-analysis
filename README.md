# Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs a detailed analysis of sales data over a 12-month period, providing insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The analysis was conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook, utilizing various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and collections.

## Project Features
- **Data Merging**: Combines sales data from 12 individual CSV files into a single DataFrame for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and removes erroneous entries to ensure data integrity.
- **Month and City Analysis**: Identifies the best month for sales and the city with the highest sales volume.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzes sales trends across different hours of the day to determine the best times for targeted advertising.
